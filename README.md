Udacity VR Nanodegree Paid
Project 1
Total hours to complete : 50
I enjoyed the full scope of the project, including installing Unity, configuring and modifying an application, building and deploying to Xcode, and finally to the device.
This gave me a great perspective on the entire build cycle and what to expect. It was a great project and I feel light years ahead of before this project.
I found the Xcode environment and Unity has a steep learning curve, even as a 30+ year experienced developer.
